# ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM

This project analyzes student performance data using innovative data wrangling and visualization techniques. Data wrangling involves cleaning and filtering the dataset to create specific DataFrames that focus on particular student groups based on predetermined criteria. Following this, data visualization is utilized to visually represent the findings, which aids in comparing performance across different tracks, genders, and hometowns.

# 1. Data Frames
By applying certain parameters and choosing specific columns, the process entails generating individual DataFrames from the dataset. For instance, one DataFrame should filter instrumentation students from Luzon with Electronics grades above 70. The choice of 'instrumentation students' and 'Luzon' as parameters, and 'Electronics grades' as a column, is significant as it allows us to focus on a specific group and their performance. A different DataFrame should be used to filter out Mindanao female students with calculated average grades of at least 55, which again, is a specific group chosen for analysis based on the parameters of 'Mindanao', 'female students', and 'average grades'. 


# 2. Visualization
To analyze how factors such as track, gender, and hometown influence students' overall average grades, this assignment requires the creation of visualizations. These graphs bring clarity to the patterns or variations in the performance of different groups, making comparisons more straightforward and the task less daunting.



The evaluations highlighted the importance of data manipulation and visualization in analyzing student performance. Filtering techniques were employed to isolate and examine specific student groups based on criteria. The visualizations facilitated easy comparisons of average grades across different tracks, genders, and hometowns. Together, these methods demonstrated that graphical representation and well-organized data manipulation can provide valuable insights into educational achievement, motivating us to continue our work.
